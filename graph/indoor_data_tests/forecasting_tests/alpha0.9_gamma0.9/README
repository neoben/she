FORECASTING TESTS

Double Exponential Weighted Moving Average Parameters:
	
	alpha = 0.9
	gamma = 0.9



Simulations performed varying the window. 

The name of the eps file indicates the used window and so the used observed values.
Eg: r2_w4.eps -> The window size is 4.
		 The observed used rssi values are those with the correspondig timestamp value smaller than 4.
